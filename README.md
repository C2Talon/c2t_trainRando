# c2t_trainRando

Uses the crimbo training manual to teach the skill to a random person on the list found in `data/c2t_trainRandoTargets.txt`. If that person already has the skill, it will just iterate through the list from that point until a valid target is found.

The list is likely not going to be maintained well, if at all, so keep an eye out for if/when the script says it tried everyone and failed. Probably stop using this after that point. Or modify the list to suit your needs.
